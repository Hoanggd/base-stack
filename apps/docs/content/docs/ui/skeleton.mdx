## Examples

### Skeleton screen
This is an example of a generic skeleton used as a placeholder for an entire screen. 
You can use this design for any screen, but it's recommended to create custom skeletons tailored to each specific page when possible.
<ComponentPreview name="SkeletonScreen" className="max-w-[600px] mt-4 mx-auto" />
