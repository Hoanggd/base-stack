## Keeping Project Structure Simple

When organizing code, simplicity should guide every decision.
While countless architectural patterns exist, from flat structures to atomic design,
layered architectures to micro-frontends, the feature-based (modular) approach strikes the best balance for most teams.

## Why Feature-Based Structure Wins

The beauty of organizing code by features is that it mirrors how we think about products.
Instead of scattering user authentication logic across `/containers`, `/app` and `/utils`,
everything lives together in an `/auth` module. This co-location means developers spend less time hunting for files and more time building.

Feature-based organization also scales naturally.
Small projects stay manageable with just a few modules, while larger applications can nest
features or split them into separate packages. When growth demands it, extracting a feature into its own microservice
becomes straightforward, the boundaries already exist in your codebase.

## A Balanced Approach

Other patterns have their place. Flat structures work for tiny projects. Atomic design excels for component libraries.
Layered architecture suits traditional enterprise applications. But feature-based organization adapts to most
scenarios without the overhead of complex rules or rigid hierarchies.

The goal isn't architectural purity, it's building software that teams can understand and maintain.
When your folder structure reflects the features users care about, everyone can navigate the codebase intuitively.

Keep it simple. Group by feature. Let your structure grow with your product.

## Examples

Both Next.js and TanStack Router support file-based routing and allow colocation of logic within route directories.
This aligns perfectly with the modular architecture philosophy of encapsulating nearly everything in the same folder.
However, these two frameworks have slight differences in their naming conventions.
